About 
==================
>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer   
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
insights to solve.   

>"_Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills 
and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathmetics._"

I'm interesting in mathematical problems for which that not
need to have a unique solution. **So just have fun!**

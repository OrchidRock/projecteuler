About 
==================
>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer   
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
insights to solve.   

>"_Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills 
and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathmetics._"

I'm interesting in mathematical problems for which that not
need to have a unique solution. **So just have fun!**

$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix} 
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0 \\
\end{vmatrix}
${$tep1}{\style{visibility:hidden}{(x+1)(x+1)}}
